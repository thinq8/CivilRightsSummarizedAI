# Package Documentation

Use this folder to store rendered documentation for the Python package located in `package_name/`.

Suggested outputs:
- Module reference pages (HTML, Markdown, or PDF) generated via Sphinx, MkDocs, or pdoc.
- Architecture overviews explaining how preprocessing, modeling, and evaluation components interact.
- Usage snippets covering CLI commands or Python entry points.

Keep filenames descriptive (e.g., `preprocessing.html`, `summarizer.md`) and include the build date or git revision in each file.
