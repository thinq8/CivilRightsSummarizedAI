# Documentation Hub

This directory collects all written resources that guide teammates and reviewers through the CivilRightsSummarizedAI project.

## Structure
- `package_name/` – API references and module-level writeups generated from the codebase.
- `images/` – Figures, diagrams, and other visuals referenced throughout the documentation.
- Additional folders will be created as design docs and experiment notes accumulate.

## Authoring Notes
- Prefer Markdown for living documents and export to HTML or PDF only for finalized deliverables.
- Keep diagrams editable (e.g., source files from draw.io, Figma) alongside exported images.
- Link documents back to milestones and meeting notes for traceability.
