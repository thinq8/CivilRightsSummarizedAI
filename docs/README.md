# Documentation

Project documentation is intentionally lightweight and focused on the active ingestion pipeline.

## Primary references
- `README.md` (repository root): setup, run commands, operations checks, and environment variables.
- `plan.md` (repository root): roadmap and phased implementation plan.
- `archive/README.md` (repository root): index of non-runtime historical/reference artifacts.

## Authoring conventions
- Keep operational runbooks close to executable code and commands.
- Prefer short Markdown documents over broad placeholder docs.
- Remove stale docs quickly when architecture changes to avoid onboarding confusion.
