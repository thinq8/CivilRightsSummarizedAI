# Documentation Images

Store diagrams, flow charts, data visualizations, and other figures referenced throughout the documentation set.

Guidelines:
- Use descriptive filenames such as `system-architecture.png` or `ui-wireframe.jpg`.
- When possible, include the editable source format (e.g., `.drawio`, `.fig`) alongside the exported image.
- Keep large datasets or raw figures in `Examples/` or a dedicated data directory instead of this folder.
