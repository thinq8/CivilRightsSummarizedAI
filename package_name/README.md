# Project Package

This directory will hold the Python package that powers CivilRightsSummarizedAI.

Planned modules:
- `module1.py` – Data ingestion and preprocessing utilities.
- `module2.py` – Summarization pipeline, model interfaces, and evaluation helpers.
- `test/` – Unit tests that protect the behavior of modules above.

As functionality grows, split features into clearly named modules (e.g., `preprocessing.py`, `summarizer.py`, `evaluation.py`) and keep public APIs documented with docstrings and examples.
