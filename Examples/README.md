# Examples and Reference Data

Use this directory to house lightweight datasets, sample outputs, and demonstration notebooks that illustrate how to run the project end-to-end.

Recommended substructure:
- `data/` – Curated CSV, JSON, or TIFF snippets that are safe to share publicly.
- `notebooks/` – Tutorial-style notebooks showcasing API usage or benchmarking workflows.
- `outputs/` – Generated summaries or evaluation metrics associated with the example data.

Avoid storing sensitive or proprietary case files in this repository. Instead, document how to access secured data sources.
